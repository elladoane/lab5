(a) What is the scope of a const variable?
a const varible cannot be updated or re declared so it's a block scope and only accessible within the block.

(b) When were the let and const keywords added to JavaScript?

According to the lab 2 slides "The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)." and "The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)" so both in 2015!

(c) If you were to change let for var in your script(s), would your script still work? Why or Why not?
If I changed let to var in my script, it might still work, but it could cause problems with scoping.
For example, if I use var inside a loop, the variable would be accessible after the loop ends, which 
could interfere with other parts of the script.
