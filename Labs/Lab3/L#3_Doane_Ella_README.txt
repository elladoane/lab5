## Built With

<!--- Provide a list of the frameworks used to build this application, your list should include the name of the framework used, the url where the framework is available for download and what the framework was used for, see the example below --->

* [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - IDE used
* [GitLab](https://git.cs.dal.ca/edoane) - Version control.

## Sources Used

If in completing your lab / assignment / project you used any interpretation of someone else's code, then provide a list of where the code was implemented, how it was implemented, why it was implemented, and how it was modified. See the sections below for more details.

### File Name: script.js

*Lines ##107 - ##134

```
function findDuplicates() {
    const seen = new Set();
    const duplicates = new Set();

    // Loop through the inventory to find duplicates
    inventory.forEach(item => {
        if (seen.has(item.name)) {
            duplicates.add(item.name);
        } else {
            seen.add(item.name);
        }
    });

    // Highlight duplicates on the page
    const inventoryList = document.getElementById('inventory-list');
    const listItems = inventoryList.getElementsByTagName('li');

    // Loop through the list items and highlight duplicates
    for (let i = 0; i < listItems.length; i++) {
        const itemName = listItems[i].innerHTML.split(' - ')[0];
        if (duplicates.has(itemName)) {
            listItems[i].style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
        } else {
            listItems[i].style.backgroundColor = '';
        }
    }
}


```

The code above was created by adapting the code in https://flexiple.com/javascript/find-duplicates-javascript-array as shown below:

I used this code for interpretation on how to go about finding a duplicate entry in an array using the SET object and also using a loop to go through and check


*Repeat as needed*


### File Name: script.js

*Lines ##45 - ##*

```
function removeItem(index) {
    inventory.splice(index, 1);
    listItems();
}

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice as shown below:

```
const months = ['Jan', 'March', 'April', 'June'];
months.splice(1, 0, 'Feb');

```

I used some examples like the one above form this website for interpretation on how to remove an item from an array


## Artificial Intelligence Tools Used
If in completing your lab / assignment / project you used any Artificial Intelligence Tools or Plugins, then provide a list of the tools or plugins used, the prompt used, the code generated by the AI, where the code was implemented, how it was implemented, why it was implemented, and how it was modified. See the sections below for more details.

### Prompt Used on *NAME OF AI TOOL*

```
generate Your inventory should include 8 items, these items should be
represented with an object and contain the following properties in js:
i. name (string)
ii. type (string)
iii. price (number)
iv. quantity (number)
v. description (string but use type of boats

```

The code prompt above was used [NAME](link) to generate the code shown below:

```
const inventory = [
    {
        name: "Yacht",
        type: "Luxury",
        price: 1000000,

    },
    {
        name: "Speedboat",
        type: "Motorized",
        price: 25000,
        quantity: 5,
        description: "A fast motorized boat for thrilling rides on the water."
    },
    {
        name: "Catamaran",
        type: "Sailing",
        price: 75000,
        quantity: 4,
        description: "A multi-hull boat known for its stability and comfort."
    },
    {
        name: "Rowboat",
        type: "Rowing",
        price: 300,
        quantity: 10,
        description: "A small boat for two people, powered by oars."
    },
    {
        name: "Fishing Boat",
        type: "Fishing",
        price: 12000,
        quantity: 8,
        description: "A boat equipped for fishing, including storage for fish and gear."
    },
    {
        name: "Submarine",
        type: "Underwater",
        price: 2000000,
        quantity: 2,
        description: "A watercraft capable of underwater operations."
    }
