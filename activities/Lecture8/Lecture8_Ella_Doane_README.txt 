## Sources Used

If in completing your lab / assignment / project you used any interpretation of someone else's code, then provide a list of where the code was implemented, how it was implemented, why it was implemented, and how it was modified. See the sections below for more details.


### File Name

*Lines ##1 - ##31*

```
Copy and paste your code on lines mentioned
let date = new Date();
let hours = date.getHours();

let welcomeMessage;

if (hours < 12) {
    welcomeMessage = "Good Morning!";
}
else if (hours < 17) {
    welcomeMessage = "Good Afternoon";
}
else if (hours < 19) {
    welcomeMessage = "Good Evening";
}
else {
    welcomeMessage = "Good Night";
}

document.getElementById('greeting').innerHTML = '<strong>' + welcomeMessage + '</strong>';

let a, b;

function getNumbers() {
    a = Number(document.getElementById('number1').value);
    b = Number(document.getElementById('number2').value);
}

function addition() {
    getNumbers();
    let result = a + b;
    alert('The sum of ' + a + ' and ' + b + ' equals ' + result);
}
```

The code above was created by adapting the code from Instructor Gabriella Mosquera in her L8V3: Traversing the DOM (Post-Lecture Video)

```

I used this snippet of code to get a baseline of the activity. I used to understand how to set up the first add function. Then I could create the other math methods.
